Ever wanted to play Pokemon on your desktop? For FREE??? Check out our Pokemon Project!

Features: 
- Can choose starter Pokemon, level them up
- Can walk around map, catch wild pokemon, find trainers to battle, and earn coins
- Can purchase pokeballs from a store
- Damage calculation inspired by traditional Pokemon game


Challenges:
- Building the classes/Pokemon database and their relationships with each other
- Implementation of walking player (We moved the map to simulate a moving character)
- How to handle animations (We used a class that updates the game on a frame by frame basis). Each animated object would have a "current state" attribute, which would be used as a reference for the next frame to be rendered.
